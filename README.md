# Angular Charity Tinder App

It's Tinder for Charities! Using Firebase for user management.

Full Stack Angular project including Node, Grunt, Bower and Yeoman using Stormpath for authentication.

UPDATE: Considering ditching this and focusing on building it in iOS9/Swift 2 instead.

TODO:
 * Work on charity pages.
 * Get some cool payment stuff
 * think I may have to write my own tinder style interface
 * removed cardflow. just not working out.
