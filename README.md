# Angular Charity Tinder App

It's Tinder for Charities! Using Firebase for user management.

Full Stack Angular project including Node, Grunt, Bower and Yeoman using Stormpath for authentication.

UPDATE: Considering ditching this and focusing on building it in iOS9/Swift 2 instead.

UPDATE2: haven't work on this in quite a while. published two apps in the Apple App Store instead.
TODO:
 * Work on charity pages.
 * Get some cool payment stuff
 * need to figure out a way to make the card slide effect work
 * need to finish this.

 Project's not quite dead yet. Been focusing on iOS stuff lately.
